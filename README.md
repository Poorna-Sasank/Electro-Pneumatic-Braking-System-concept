# Electro Pneumatic Braking System concept

The circuit consists of Electronic components that works on the concept of latching which control the pneumatic systems for the brakes.

In this circuit the need for a seperate brake signal line is eliminated by the use of electronics, so we are effectively reducing the amount of time needed for the brake signal to reach the last coach.

The brakes apply in a sequential manner which is how a train brake works :)
